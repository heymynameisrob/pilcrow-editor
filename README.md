# Pilcrow Editor

This is an exact copy of the editor experience in [Pilcrow](https://pilcrow.xyz). A few modifications have been made so that it works right out the box. However, most of the functionality is there. Including:

- Full node-based text editing
- Slash commands
- AI Complete (OpenAI key needed)
- AI Assistance
- Annotations
- Snippets

## How it works

## Run it locally
Clone the repo and install everything. Make sure you use the correct node version with `nvm`

```bash
nvm use
```

then run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
